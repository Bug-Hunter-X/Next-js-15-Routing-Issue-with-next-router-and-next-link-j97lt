# Next.js 15 Routing Issue

This repository demonstrates an unexpected routing behavior in Next.js 15 when using `next/router` and `next/link` together for navigation. The issue is that the browser URL doesn't always update correctly, causing problems with state management and potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

When navigating between pages (`pages/index.js` and `pages/about.js`), the URL might not reflect the current page accurately, even though the content updates correctly. This is inconsistent behavior and can create difficulties in managing application state.

## Solution

The solution to this problem usually involves ensuring consistent use of either `next/router` or `next/link` for all navigation.  Mixing the two can lead to conflicts in how Next.js manages the client-side routing. The solution may also involve ensuring that any state updates are handled correctly in response to routing changes.
